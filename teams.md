## Why isn't this on Microsoft Teams?
We've gotten this question a lot in our short lifetime - there are a couple of reasons:
- Teams has some user limitations and licensing limitations that, at least for now, make it a bigger hurdle to cross
- This isn't an offically-sanctioned channel, just a community of people who are using or are interested in Azure - we want to get closest to everyone without onerous requirements.

As Teams continues to mature, however, we'll constantly re-evaluate when it might be worth a switch. For now, Slack is the best place.
